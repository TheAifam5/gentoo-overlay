    Automatic Version bump and changelog: automatically bump versions and generate changelogs with your own custom steps and workflows.
    Release profiles: your branching model requires different steps for releases, pre-release, hotfixes ? We got you covered !
    Depends only on libgit2: cocogitto has two standalone binaries, the only system dependency is libgit2.
    Conventional git log: search your commit history matching Conventional Commits items such as scope and commit type.
    GitHub integration: enforce the conventional commits specification with our GitHub action and bot.
