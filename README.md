# TheAifam5's Personal Gentoo Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to offer ebuilds for packages
that are either unavailable in the official Gentoo repository, experimental,
or neglected by Gentoo/GURU Developers. Additionally, it aims to provide ebuilds
that minimize dependencies and are highly configurable through USE flags.

## [!CAUTION]

I do not guarantee the stability of the ebuilds in this repository. Use them at your own risk.
